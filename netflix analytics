Select count (*)

where type = 'Movie';

/* List all the movies and tv shows in alphabetical order */
select title
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
ORDER BY title asc;

/*  When was the most recent batch of tv shows and/or movies added to the database? */
Select max (date (date_added))
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"

/* Who was the Director for the movie Bright Star?*/
Select 
director
From "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" titles
Left Join "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" peoples
On titles.show_id=peoples.show_id

/*  What is the oldest movie in the database and what year was it made?*/
select title, release_year

ORDER BY release_year asc
LIMIT 1;
